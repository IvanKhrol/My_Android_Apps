# Diary
## This is not the final version of the app, but it's my priority project.
## This application is designed to keep a diary of a diabetic and analyze it.
### In the near future it will be possible to:
1. Keeping a diary in the form of a table;
2. building a graph of sugars for different periods of time;
3. save spreadsheet in excel format.
### In the future it is planned:
1. Adding a product database;
2. atomatic calculation of the amount of insulin;
3. and many other things that come to my mind or need :)
