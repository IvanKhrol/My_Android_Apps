# PE Visits
## This is not the final version of the app.
## This is a simple application to track the number of physical education visits. It was done more for educational purposes than for functional purposes.
### Its functionality includes:
1. Working with a list of data:
    - adding fields to the end of the list;
    - deleting and editing any field;
2. creating an auxiliary pop-up window with a calendar.
### In the future it is planned:
1. Ð¡reating a widget to quickly add visits;
2. the ability to change the appearance of the application.
